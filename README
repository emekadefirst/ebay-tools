# eBay Product API

## Description

This project consists of two scripts:

- **api.py**: A FastAPI application that serves as an API for retrieving eBay product information from a SQLite database.
- **fetch.py**: A script that scrapes eBay product data and inserts it into the SQLite database.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12 or higher
- Libraries: FastAPI, sqlmodel, requests, BeautifulSoup

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository to your local machine.**

2. **Install the required libraries:**
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi sqlmodel requests beautifulsoup4
   ```

3. **Run the `fetch.py` script to populate the SQLite database with eBay product data:**
   ```bash
   python fetch.py
   ```

4. **Run the `api.py` script to start the FastAPI server:**
   ```bash
   python api.py
   ```

5. **Access the API endpoints:**
   - **`/products/`**: Get a list of products.
   - **`/product/{product_id}`**: Get a specific product by ID.
   - **`/search/?query={search_query}`**: Search for products based on a query string.

## Note

- By default, the API server runs on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
- Ensure that the SQLite database (`data.db`) exists in the project directory.
